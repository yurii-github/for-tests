HANDLING ERRORS

app has error logger via php error handler
app can catch most of its errors


BUG

because eval() is unsecure, i cannot fully check input data, i did sample check on content start as 'array(' but it is ot enough.
So if bad data was provided app will fail with parse error or can be used to compromise app. Better was is to use serialization, but as
task requires such input I was forced to keep it that way.

 
TESTS

due to small amount of time i did unit testing only for critical part in model and some demonstration for functional testing of controller
